Welcome to the 33rd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

A New Book!

Game Development with Rust and WebAssembly by Eric Smith (a.k.a @paytonrules)
was published in April. It takes a tutorial approach to leading the reader
through building an endless runner using Rust and WebAssembly.

From the Summary: This book is an easy-to-follow reference to help you develop
your own games, teaching you all about game development and how to create an
endless runner from scratch. You'll begin by drawing simple graphics in the
browser window, and then learn how to move the main character across the screen.
You'll also create a game loop, a renderer, and more, all written entirely in
Rust. After getting simple shapes onto the screen, you'll scale the challenge by
adding sprites, sounds, and user input. As you advance, you'll discover how to
implement a procedurally generated world. Finally, you'll learn how to keep your
Rust code clean and organized so you can continue to implement new features and
deploy your app on the web.
